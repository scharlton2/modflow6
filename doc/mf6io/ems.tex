An explicit model solution (EMS) is specified within the SOLUTIONGROUP block in the simulation name file.  The explicit model solution requires the individual models that are added to it to solve themselves.  The explicit model solution presently works with the Particle Tracking (PRT) Model, which solves for particle trajectories.  The current input file for EMS has no options or input; however an empty input file is required if EMS is required for particle tracking.

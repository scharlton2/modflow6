Input to the Output Control Option of the Surface Water Flow Model is read from the file that is specified as type ``OC6'' in the Name File. If no ``OC6'' file is specified, default output control is used. The Output Control Option determines how and when outflows are printed to the listing file and/or written to a separate binary output file.  Under the default, outflow and overall flow budget are written to the Listing File at the end of every stress period. The default printout format for concentrations is 10G11.4.  The outflow and overall flow budget are also written to the list file if the simulation terminates prematurely due to failed convergence.

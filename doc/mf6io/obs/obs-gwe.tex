Observations are available for GWE models and GWE stress packages. Available observation types have been listed for each package that supports observations (tables~\ref{table:gweobstype} to~\ref{table:gwe-cntobstype}). All available observation types are repeated in Table~\ref{table:gwe-obstypetable} for convenience. 

The sign convention adopted for transport observations are identical to the conventions used in budgets contained in listing files and used in the cell-by-cell budget output. For flow-ja-face observation types, negative and positive values represent a loss from and gain to the cellid specified for ID, respectively. For standard stress packages, negative and positive values represent a loss from and gain to the GWE model, respectively. For advanced transport packages (Package = LKE, MWE, SFE, and UZE), negative and positive values for exchanges with the GWE model (Observation type = lke, mwe, sfe, and uze) represent a loss from and gain to the GWE model, respectively. For other advanced stress package flow terms, negative and positive values represent a loss from and gain from the advanced package, respectively.

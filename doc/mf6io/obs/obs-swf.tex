Observations are available for SWF models and SWF stress packages. Available observation types have been listed for each package that supports observations (tables~\ref{table:swfobstype}. All available observation types are repeated in Table~\ref{table:swf-obstypetable} for convenience. 

The sign convention adopted for transport observations are identical to the conventions used in budgets contained in listing files and used in the cell-by-cell budget output. For flow-ja-face observation types, negative and positive values represent a loss from and gain to the cellid specified for ID, respectively. For standard stress packages, negative and positive values represent a loss from and gain to the GWT model, respectively.

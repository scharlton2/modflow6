Mover Energy Transport (MVE) Package information is read from the file that is specified by ``MVE6'' as the file type.  Only one MVE Package can be specified for a GWE model.  

The MVE Package is used to route thermal energy according to flows from the GWF Water Mover (MVR) Package.  The MVE Package must be activated by the user if the MVR Package is active in the corresponding the GWF Model.  Flows from the GWF MVR Package must be available to the GWE model either through activation of a GWF-GWE Exchange or through specification of ``GWFMOVER'' in the PACKAGEDATA block of the GWE FMI Package.

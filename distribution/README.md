## Overview

MODFLOW 6 releases come in two flavors:

- nightly development builds
- full/approved distributions

Development builds are created nightly from the tip of the `develop` branch and released from the [`MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build` repository](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build). Development distributions contain only MODFLOW 6 input/output documentation, release notes, `code.json` metadata, and core executables and libraries:

- `mf6`: MODFLOW 6 executable
- `zbud6`: Zonebudget executable
- `mf5to6`: MODFLOW 5 to 6 converter executable
- `libmf6`: MODFLOW 6 dynamic library

Full distributions contain the items listed above, as well as:

- Meson build files
- Fortran source code
- MODFLOW 6 example models
- MODFLOW 6 makefiles
- MODFLOW 6 Visual Studio files
- more extensive documentation, including:
  - MODFLOW 6 input/output docs
  - MODFLOW 6 example model docs
  - MODFLOW 6 release notes
  - MODFLOW 6 supplementary technical information
  - docs for various MODFLOW 6 features and packages
  - docs for `mf5to6` and `zbud6`

Official releases can be classified further into two types: patch and minor releases. Patch releases should typically branch from `master` and cherry-pick relevant commits, since `develop` may contain broader changes not yet ready for release. Minor releases typically branch from `develop`. MODFLOW 6 does not currently increment the major version number.

Both nightly builds and official distributions are created automatically with GitHub Actions.

## Requirements

This document assumes a MODFLOW 6 development environment has been configured as per the [developer documentation](../DEVELOPER.md), including a Fortran compiler (either `ifort` or `gfortran`) as well as a Pixi environment as specified in `pixi.toml`. Official distributions are currently prepared with Intel Fortran (`ifort`).

## Steps

Broadly, steps to prepare an official release for distribution include:

- update release notes for the release (and reset them after)
- update version information with `update_version.py`
- (re)build makefiles with `build_makefiles.py`
- benchmark example models with `benchmark.py`
- build the MF6IO documentation with `build_docs.py`
- build the distribution archive with `build_dist.py`
- verify the distribution archive with `check_dist.py`

These should occur roughly in the order presented above. The procedure is automated in the `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `release_dispatch.yml` workflows.

**Note**: `git`- and/or GitHub-related steps are omitted from this section. See the [Procedure](#procedure) section below for a step-by-step recipe for creating and distributing release with the help of GitHub Actions.

### Update release notes

The release notes document is constructed from the `doc/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes.tex` LaTeX file. During each development cycle, release notes should be maintained in `doc/ReleaseNotes/develop.tex` &mdash; this file is referenced from `doc/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes.tex`.

Before making a release, add a line to the Release History section of `ReleaseNotes.tex` providing the version number, date and DOI of the current release, e.g. `6.4.4 & February 13, 2024 & \url{https://doi.org/10.5066/P9FL1JCC}`.

After each release is made, several steps are required to reset the release notes for the next development cycle:

- copy `develop.tex` into a new file `doc/ReleaseNotes/previous/vx.y.z.tex` (where `x.y.z` is the semantic version just released)
- add a new entry like `\input{./previous/vx.y.z.tex}` to line 3 of `doc/ReleaseNotes/appendixA.tex`
- overwrite `develop.tex` with the contents of `doc/ReleaseNotes/vx.y.z-template.tex`

Now new changes can be added to `develop.tex` as development proceeds.

**Note**: Newly deprecated MF6IO options are included in the release notes. See the [developer docs](../DEVELOPER.md#deprecation-policy) for more info on MF6's deprecation policy, searching for deprecations among DFNs, and generating a deprecations table for insertion into the release notes.

### Update version info

MODFLOW 6 version numbers follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) convention `major.minor.patch`. Release tags do *not* include an initial `v`, as is common in many other projects.

Version information is stored primarily in `version.txt` in the project root, as well as in several other files in the repository.

The `update_version.py` script updates files containing version information. First a file lock is acquired, then repository files are updated, then the lock is released.

The version can be specified with the `--version` (short `-v`) option. For instance, to set version to `6.4.1`, run from the `scripts/` folder:

```shell
python update_version.py -v 6.4.1
```

If no `--version` is provided, the version is not changed, only the build timestamp.

An optional label may be appended to the release number, e.g.

```shell
python update_version.py -v 6.4.2rc
```

The label must start immediately following the patch version number, with no space in between. The label may contain numeric characters or symbols, but *must not* start with a number (otherwise there is no way to distinguish it from the patch version number).

The `update_version.py` script has a few other flags:

- `--approved` (short `-a`): approve an official release. If the `--approved` flag is provided, disclaimer language is altered to reflect approval. If the flag is not provided, the language reflects preliminary/provisional status and `(preliminary)` is appended to version numbers.

- `--releasemode` (short `-r`): toggle whether binaries are built in development or release mode by editing the contents of `src/Utilities/version.f90`. If the `--releasemode` flag is provided, `IDEVELOPMODE` is set to 0. If `--releasemode` is not provided, `IDEVELOPMODE` is set to 1.

- `--get` (short `-g`): print the current version number to `stdout` without making any updates.

- `--citation` (short `-c`): generate a citation from the contents of `CITATION.cff` and print it to `stdout`, again without making any updates.

### Build makefiles

The `build_makefiles.py` script is used to rewrite makefiles after Fortran source files have been added, removed, or renamed. Up-to-date makefiles must be generated for inclusion in a distribution. A pixi task `build-makefiles` is also available.

### Build example models

MODFLOW 6 [example models](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-examples) are bundled with official releases. Example models must be built and run to generate plots and tables before documentation can be generated. The `release.yml` workflow attempts to download the latest release from the examples repository, only re-building and re-running example models if no such release is available. See the examples repository for more information on preparing example models.

### Benchmark example models

MODFLOW 6 documentation includes a performance evaluation comparing the current version against the last official release. Benchmarks must run before a release can be prepared. Benchmarks run as a component of the `docs.yml` CI workflow &mdash; `release.yml` attempts to download benchmark results if available, only re-running them if necessary.

The `benchmark.py` script benchmarks the current development version of MODFLOW 6 against the latest release rebuilt in development mode, using the models from the `MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-examples` repository. Paths to pre-built binaries for both versions can be provided via the `--current-bin-path` (short `-c`) and `--previous-bin-path` (short `-p`) command line options. If bin paths are not provided, executables are rebuilt in the default locations:

`<project root>/bin`: current development version
`<project root>/bin/rebuilt`: previous version

The examples repository must first be installed and prepared as described above. Its path may be explicitly provided with the `--examples-repo-path` (short `-e`) option. If no path is provided, the repository is assumed to be named `modflow6-examples` and live side-by-side with the `modflow6` repository on the filesystem.

The directory to write benchmark results can be specified with `--output-path` (short `-o`). If no such option is provided, results are written to the current working directory.

```shell
python benchmark.py -e ../modflow6-examples -o .benchmarks
```

The above will write results to a markdown file `.benchmarks/run-time-comparison.md` relative to the project root.

### Build documentation

Extensive documentation is bundled with official MODFLOW 6 releases. MODFLOW 6 documentation is written in LaTeX. Some LaTeX files (in particular for MODFLOW 6 input/output documentation) are automatically generated from DFN files. The `release.yml` workflow first runs `update_version.py` to update version strings to be substituted into the docs, then runs `build_docs.py` to regenerate LaTeX files where necessary, download benchmark results (and convert the Markdown results file to LaTeX), download publications hosted on the USGS website, and finally convert LaTeX to PDFs.

Manually building MODFLOW 6 documentation requires additional Python dependencies specified in `build_rtd_docs/requirements.rtd.txt`. Styles defined in the [`MODFLOW-USGS/usgslatex`](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/usgslatex) are also required. (See that repository's `README` for installation instructions or this repo's [`../.github/workflows/docs.yml](../.github/workflows/docs.yml) CI workflow for an example.)

### Build the distribution archive

After each step above is complete, the `build_dist.py` script can be used to construct the MODFLOW 6 distribution. The `build_dist.py` script can be used to create both minimal and full distributions. By default, a minimal distribution is created. To create a full distribution, run the script with the `--full` flag.

The `build_dist.py` script is lazy &mdash; benchmarks, example models and documentation artifacts are downloaded via the GitHub API if available, and only re-created if none exist or the `--force` (`-f`) flag is provided. This allows the release workflow to consume artifacts previously created by other workflow runs, reducing the time needed to create and publish a release.

The script has several other arguments:

- `--build-path`: path to the build workspace, defaults to `<project root>/builddir`
- `--output-path (-o)`: path to create a distribution zipfile, defaults to `<project root>/distribution/`
- `--examples-repo-path (-e)`: path to the [`MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-examples`](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-examples) repository, defaults to `modflow6-examples` side-by-side with project root
- `--force (-f)`: whether to recreate and overwrite preexisting components of the distribution, if they already exist

Default paths are resolved relative to the script's location on the filesystem, *not* the current working directory, so the script can be run from `distribution/`, from the project root, or from anywhere else. This is true of all scripts in the `distribution/` directory.

See [the `release.yml` workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) for a complete example of how to build a distribution archive.

### Verify the distribution archive

The `check_dist.py` script can be used to check the release distribution folder. The `--path` argument is the path to the dist folder. The `--approved` flag can be used to signal that the release is approved/official. By default the release is assumed preliminary. The script checks the version string emitted by `mf6 -v` for the presence or absence of "preliminary" depending on this flag.

## Procedure

The steps above are automated in the `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `release_dispatch.yml` workflows. The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow is used for both nightly builds and official releases. It should not be necessary to prepare a release manually.

The `release.yml` workflow has no triggers of its own, and must be dispatched by `.github/workflows/release_dispatch.yml`, in one of two ways:

- Push a release branch to the `MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6` repository. This method should be used for proper releases. 
- Manually trigger the workflow via GitHub CLI or web UI. Useful for testing release candidates or verifying the release automation before a final release is made &mdash; see the [Testing](#testing) section below for more detail.

To release an official version of MODFLOW 6 via the release branch method:

1. Create a release candidate branch from the tip of `develop` or `master`. The branch's name must begin with `v` followed by the version number. For an officially approved release, include *only* the version number. For a preliminary release candidate, append `rc` after the version number, e.g. `v6.4.0rc`. If the branch name does not end in `rc`, the release is assumed to be approved.
2. Push the branch to the `MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6` repository. This triggers the release workflow. If the release is still an unapproved candidate (i.e. the branch name ends with `rc`) binaries are built with `IDEVELOPMODE` set to 1, and the workflow ends after uploading binaries and documentation artifacts for inspection. If the release is approved/official, the workflow drafts a pull request against the `master` branch.
3. To continue with the release, merge (**do not squash**) the PR into `master`. This triggers another job to tag the new tip of `master` with the release number, draft a release, and upload binaries and documentation as release assets.
4. If the release assets pass inspection, publish the release. The following format convention is used for the GitHub release post:

    ```
    This is the approved USGS MODFLOW <semver> release.
  
    <authors>, <release year>, MODFLOW 6 Modular Hydrologic Model version <semver>: U.S. Geological Survey Software Release, <release date>, <doi link>
  
    Visit the USGS "MODFLOW and Related Programs" site for information on MODFLOW 6 and related software: https://doi.org/10.5066/F76Q1VQV
    ```

5. Create a branch from `master`, naming it something like `post-release-x.y.z-reset`. Run `distribution/update_version.py -v x.y.z.devN`, substituting `x`, `y`, `z` and `N` as appropriate for the next development cycle's version number. This will substitute the version number into all necessary files and will also set `IDEVELOPMODE` back to 1. Reset release notes as described [above](#update-release-notes). Open a pull request into `master` from the reset branch. Merge (**do not squash**) the PR.

**Note**: Squashing the release PR into `master` or the post-release reset PR into `develop` causes `develop` and `master` to diverge, leading to conflicts at the next release time. Both pull requests should be **merged with a merge commit**, *not* squashed.

## Testing

Each script used in the release procedure can be tested separately. The procedure can also be tested end-to-end by manually dispatching the release workflow.

### Testing release scripts

Each script in `distribution/` contains its own tests. To run them, run `pytest` from the `distribution/` folder. The tests will not be discovered if `pytest` is run from a different location, as the scripts in this folder are not named `test_*.py` and are only discoverable by virtue of the patterns provided in `distribution/pytest.ini`.  The tests use temporary directories where possible and revert modifications to tracked files on teardown.

**Note:** the tests clean up by reverting changes to files in the following locations:

- `doc/`
- `make`
- `utils/**/make/`

Make sure you don't have any uncommitted changes in these locations before running the tests.

**Note:** to avoid contested file access, the tests will refuse to run in parallel with `pytest-xdist`.

There is a small additional suite of tests that can be used to validate a release distribution folder after it is built: `check_dist.py`. These tests are run as part of the release workflow &mdash; see below for more detail.

### Testing the release workflow

The `workflow_dispatch` event is GitHub's mechanism for manually triggering workflows. This can be accomplished from the Actions tab in the GitHub UI. This is a convenient way to test the release procedure and evaluate release candidate distributions.

To dispatch the release workflow, navigate to the Actions tab of this repository. Select the release dispatch workflow. A `Run workflow` button should be visible in an alert at the top of the list of workflow runs. Click the `Run workflow` button, selecting values for the various inputs:

- `approve`: whether the release is officially approved, or just a release candidate
- `branch`: the branch to release from
- `development`: whether to build a minimal development distribution or a full distribution
- `run_tests`: whether to run autotests after building binaries
- `version`: the version number of the release
